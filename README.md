Personal Portfolio.

This project contains all the files I used to create my personal portfolio/website.
I mainly used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to complete my portfolio.

The portfolio site contains three sections namely a home section, about me section, projects section and a contact me section.
The project took me two weeks to complete before I started to push my work to Github.
I continually make changes and try to fix and clean code where I can. The project will be updated as I improve my coding skills. 

Simple features like a nav-bar and other components like a contact me form are also present in this project. I learned alot during the process of creating this website and watched several tutorials and read up on many CSS features to successfully compile my website. I also learned how to use a free web hosting service, Netlify, to host and deploy my website. Learning by doing is a true saying. I experienced many issues that I had to Google to be able to resolve like Media query breakpoints. The part I enjoyed most was the CSS of this project. I created a few animations for the site and chose some colors I feel pleased with. The website is very basic and is reponsive to all screen sizes.

The section I put most effort into was the projects section. I feel this is the most important part of my website as it presents all of my other work together.

My portfolio is one of my projects that I'm most proud of and is a showcase of my current coding skills.
